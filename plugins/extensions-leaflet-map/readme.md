## Description

Extends the WordPress Plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-map/">Leaflet Map</a> with Leaflet Plugins and other functions.

### Functions

* Create an elevation chart profile of a track. There are also acceleration, slope, speed and tempo chart profiles. You can also place multiple tracks on one map.

* By default Leaflet Map uses tiles from openstreetmap.org or from the tile servers you configured. You can use more and switch between them.

* Many markers on a map become confusing. You can cluster and shape them.

* You can use Awesome markers.

* You can group the elements on the map by criteria and show/hide them.

* Create an overview map with geo-locations provided in the pages and posts.

* Get a tooltip when hovering over an element.

* You can design a choropleth map.

* You can display the map in fullscreen mode.

* Reset the map.

* Gesture handling

* Manage your files for Leaflet Map.

* Help to migrate from [WP GPX Maps](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gpx-maps/).

* and more functions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a widget or other support for the editor?**

* Unfortunately both plugins - Leaflet Map and Extensions for Leaflet Map - only work with shortcodes.
* If you have any questions please ask in the [forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/extensions-leaflet-map/).

**My gpx file is not displayed!**

* Is the URL correct?
* Does the webserver return the correct mime type (application/gpx+xml)?
Put in your `.htaccess`:
<pre><code>AddType application/gpx+xml gpx
RewriteRule .*\\.gpx$ - [L,T=application/gpx+xml]</code></pre>

* Are you using any plugin to comply with the GDPR/DSGVO? There might be a problem with that.
* If you use a caching plugin and a GDPR/DSGVO plugin you need to distinguish whether the user has accepted the cookie or not.
